# Avalanche Console Integration

This document outlines the integration of the Avalanche Console into the main Builders Hub project.

## Overview

The Avalanche Console has been successfully integrated as a new tool under `/tools/console/` to provide developers with:

- **API Key Management**: Create and manage API keys for Avalanche services
- **Testnet Faucet**: Request test tokens (AVAX, USDC, USDT) for development
- **RPC Endpoints**: Access to free mainnet and testnet RPC endpoints
- **Webhooks API**: Configure real-time blockchain event notifications

## Integration Structure

### Routes Created
- `/tools/console/` - Main console dashboard
- `/tools/console/api-keys/` - API key management
- `/tools/console/faucet/` - Testnet token faucet
- `/tools/console/rpcs/` - RPC endpoint information
- `/tools/console/webhooks-api/` - Webhook configuration

```

## Navigation Integration

The console has been added to the main navigation in two places:

1. **Tools Menu** (`app/layout.config.tsx`): Added as "Developer Console" in the tools dropdown
2. **Tools Page** (`app/(home)/tools/page.tsx`): Added as a featured tool card

## Features

### API Key Management
- Create new API keys with custom names
- View existing keys with masked/revealed display
- Copy keys to clipboard
- Delete unused keys
- Security best practices information

### Testnet Faucet
- Support for multiple networks (Fuji C-Chain, X-Chain, P-Chain)
- Multiple token types (AVAX, USDC, USDT)
- Daily limits and usage information
- Coupon code support

### RPC Endpoints
- Mainnet and testnet endpoints
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Network status indicators
- Usage guidelines and best practices

### Webhooks API
- Create webhooks for blockchain events
- Support for multiple event types
- Webhook status management
- Event configuration and monitoring

## Dependencies

The integration reuses existing dependencies from the main project:
- All Radix UI components were already present
- Uses existing UI components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- Leverages the project's existing styling system
- Uses Sonner for toast notifications (already included)

## Usage

Users can access the Avalanche Console through:
1. Main navigation: Tools → Developer Console
2. Tools page: Click on the "Avalanche Console" card
3. Direct URL: `/tools/console`

## Development Notes

- All components are client-side rendered with proper error boundaries
- Uses the existing project's design system and styling
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Follows the project's existing patterns for routing and component structure

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Integration with real Avalanche APIs
- User authentication and session management
- Enhanced analytics and monitoring
- Additional developer tools and utilities
