## Overview

Quadrata is a Passport Network that brings identity and compliance solutions to decentralized applications on public blockchains. Through its innovative approach, Quadrata enables Web3 applications to access KYC/AML status, country of residence, credit reputation, and accredited investor status while preserving user privacy. Quadrata's soulbound tokens provide a portable digital identity that can be seamlessly integrated with txAllowlist precompiles to create compliant, permissioned environments on Avalanche.

## Features

- **Privacy-Preserving KYC**: Verification without storing personal identifiable information (PII) on-chain.
- **Soulbound Token Passport**: Non-transferable NFT that attaches to the user's wallet and contains verified credentials.
- **AML Screening**: Includes anti-money laundering checks to ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Global Verification**: Provides country verification to help applications comply with regional restrictions.
- **Portable Identity**: Users can verify once and use their Quadrata Passport across multiple integrated applications.
- **Business Verification (KYB)**: Offers verification for business entities as well as individuals.
- **Age Verification**: Supports age verification for age-restricted applications.
- **Wallet Screening**: Analyzes wallet history and transactions for risk assessment.

## Getting Started

To integrate Quadrata into your Avalanche-based application, follow these steps:

1. **Schedule a Demo**: Connect with the Quadrata team through their [website](https://quadrata.com/#schedule-demo) to discuss your specific needs.
2. **Integration Planning**: Work with Quadrata to design the optimal integration for your application.
3. **Technical Implementation**: Follow the integration guides in the [documentation](https://docs.quadrata.com/) to implement Quadrata's verification system.
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the integration to ensure it works as expected.
5. **Launch**: Deploy the integration and begin accepting users with Quadrata Passports.

## Integration with txAllowlist

Quadrata works exceptionally well with Avalanche's txAllowlist precompile for creating permissioned networks:

1. **Passport Verification**: Users obtain a Quadrata Passport through the verification process.
2. **Smart Contract Integration**: Your application's smart contracts can check for the presence and validity of a user's Quadrata Passport.
3. **Allowlist Management**: Upon confirming a valid Passport, the user's address can be added to the txAllowlist.
4. **Compliant Transactions**: Only users with verified Passports can transact on the chain, ensuring regulatory compliance.

This creates a seamless verification flow where users' privacy is preserved while still maintaining compliance standards.
