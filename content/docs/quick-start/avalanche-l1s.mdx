An <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> is a sovereign network which defines its own rules regarding its membership and token economics. It is composed of a dynamic subset of <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s working together to achieve <GlossaryTerm>consensus</GlossaryTerm> on the state of one or more <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s. Each <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm> is validated by exactly one <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>, while an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> can validate many <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s.

<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm>'s [<GlossaryTerm>Primary Network</GlossaryTerm>](/docs/quick-start/primary-network) is a special <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> running three <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s:

- The <GlossaryTerm>Platform Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>P-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#p-chain)
- The <GlossaryTerm>Contract Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>C-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#c-chain)
- The <GlossaryTerm>Exchange Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>X-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#x-chain)

<Callout title="Note">
Every <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm> of an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> **must** sync the <GlossaryTerm>P-Chain</GlossaryTerm> of the <GlossaryTerm>Primary Network</GlossaryTerm> for interoperability.
</Callout>

<GlossaryTerm>Node</GlossaryTerm> operators that validate an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> with multiple chains do not need to run multiple machines for validation. For example, the <GlossaryTerm>Primary Network</GlossaryTerm> is an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> with three coexisting chains, all of which can be validated by a single <GlossaryTerm>node</GlossaryTerm>, or a single machine.

## Advantages

### Independent Networks

- <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s use <GlossaryTerm>virtual machine</GlossaryTerm>s to specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security.
- Each <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>'s performance is isolated from other <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s in the ecosystem, so increased usage on one <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> won't affect another.
- <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s can have their own token economics with their own native <GlossaryTerm>token</GlossaryTerm>s, fee markets, and incentives determined by the <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> deployer.
- One <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> can host multiple <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s with customized [<GlossaryTerm>virtual machine</GlossaryTerm>s](/docs/quick-start/virtual-machines).

### Native Interoperability

<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> Warp Messaging enables native cross-<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> communication and allows <GlossaryTerm>Virtual Machine</GlossaryTerm> (VM) developers to implement arbitrary communication protocols between any two <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s.

### Accommodate App-Specific Requirements

Different <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>-based applications may require <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s to have certain properties such as large amounts of RAM or CPU power.

an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> could require that <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s meet certain [hardware requirements](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/manually#hardware-and-os-requirements) so that the application doesn't suffer from low performance due to slow <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s.

### Launch Networks Designed With Compliance

<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm>'s L1 architecture makes regulatory compliance manageable. As mentioned above, an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> may require <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s to meet a set of requirements.

Some examples of requirements the creators of an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> may choose include:

- <GlossaryTerm>Validator</GlossaryTerm>s must be located in a given country.
- <GlossaryTerm>Validator</GlossaryTerm>s must pass KYC/AML checks.
- <GlossaryTerm>Validator</GlossaryTerm>s must hold a certain license.

### Control Privacy of On-Chain Data

<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s are ideal for organizations interested in keeping their information private.

Institutions conscious of their stakeholders' privacy can create a private <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> where the contents of the <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s would be visible only to a set of pre-approved <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s.

Define this at creation with a [single parameter](/docs/nodes/configure/avalanche-l1-configs#private-avalanche-l1).

### Validator Sovereignty

In a heterogeneous network of <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s, some <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s will not want to validate certain <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s because they simply have no interest in those <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s.

The <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> model enables <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s to concern themselves only with <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm> networks they choose to participate in. This greatly reduces the computational burden on <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm>s.

## Develop Your Own Avalanche L1

<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s on <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> are deployed by default with [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm#subnet-evm), a fork of go-ethereum. It implements the <GlossaryTerm>Ethereum</GlossaryTerm> <GlossaryTerm>Virtual Machine</GlossaryTerm> and supports Solidity <GlossaryTerm>smart contract</GlossaryTerm>s as well as most other <GlossaryTerm>Ethereum</GlossaryTerm> client functionality.

To get started, check out our [L1 Launcher](/tools/l1-launcher) or the tutorials in the [<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> CLI](/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-l1) section.
