<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> is a heterogeneous network of <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>s. As opposed to homogeneous networks, where all applications reside in the same chain, heterogeneous networks allow separate chains to be created for different applications.

The <GlossaryTerm>Primary Network</GlossaryTerm> is a special [<GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>](/docs/quick-start/avalanche-l1s) that runs three blockchains:

- The <GlossaryTerm>Platform Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>P-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#p-chain)
- The <GlossaryTerm>Contract Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>C-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#c-chain)
- The <GlossaryTerm>Exchange Chain</GlossaryTerm> [(<GlossaryTerm>X-Chain</GlossaryTerm>)](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#x-chain)

<Callout title="Note">
[Avalanche Mainnet](/docs/quick-start/networks/mainnet) is comprised of the Primary Network and all deployed Avalanche L1s.
</Callout>

A <GlossaryTerm>node</GlossaryTerm> can become a <GlossaryTerm>validator</GlossaryTerm> for the Primary Network by <GlossaryTerm>staking</GlossaryTerm> at least **2,000 AVAX**.

## The Chains

All validators of the Primary Network are required to validate and secure the following:

### C-Chain

The **C-Chain** is an implementation of the <GlossaryTerm>Ethereum</GlossaryTerm> <GlossaryTerm>Virtual Machine</GlossaryTerm> (EVM). The [C-Chain's API](/docs/api-reference/c-chain/api) supports Geth's API and supports the deployment and execution of <GlossaryTerm>smart contract</GlossaryTerm>s written in Solidity.

The C-Chain is an instance of the <GlossaryTerm>Coreth</GlossaryTerm> Virtual Machine.

### P-Chain

The **P-Chain** is responsible for all validator and Avalanche L1-level operations. The [P-Chain API](/docs/api-reference/p-chain/api) supports the creation of new blockchains and Avalanche L1s, the addition of validators to Avalanche L1s, staking operations, and other platform-level operations.

The P-Chain is an instance of the <GlossaryTerm>Platform Virtual Machine</GlossaryTerm>.

### X-Chain

The **X-Chain** is responsible for operations on digital smart assets known as **Avalanche Native <GlossaryTerm>Token</GlossaryTerm>s**. A smart asset is a representation of a real-world resource (for example, equity, or a bond) with sets of rules that govern its behavior, like "can't be traded until tomorrow." The [X-Chain API](/docs/api-reference/x-chain/api) supports the creation and trade of Avalanche Native Tokens.

One asset traded on the X-Chain is AVAX. When you issue a transaction to a blockchain on Avalanche, you pay a fee denominated in AVAX.

The X-Chain is an instance of the <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche Virtual Machine</GlossaryTerm> (AVM).
