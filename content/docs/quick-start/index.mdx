## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications in one interoperable, decentralized, and highly scalable ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Blazingly Fast**: Sub-2 second transaction finality with the fastest consensus mechanism of any Layer 1
- **Built to Scale**: Create application-specific blockchains or build on existing L1s in any language
- **EVM Compatible**: Deploy Solidity contracts straight out-of-the-box
- **Energy Efficient**: Consumes the same energy as 46 US households (0.0005% of Bitcoin)
- **Advanced Security**: Scales to thousands of validators without performance degradation

### Architecture

Avalanche uses a unique [consensus mechanism](/docs/quick-start/avalanche-consensus) and consists of:

- **[Primary Network](/docs/primary-network)**: The main network with X, P, and C-Chains
- **[Avalanche L1s](/docs/quick-start/avalanche-l1s)**: Custom blockchains with their own rules and tokens
- **[Virtual Machines](/docs/quick-start/virtual-machines)**: Execution environments for different use cases
