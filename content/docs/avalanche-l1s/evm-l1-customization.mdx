Welcome to the Subnet-EVM customization guide. This documentation explores how to extend and customize your Avalanche L1 using **Subnet-EVM** and **precompiles**. Building upon the Validator Manager capabilities we discussed in the previous section, we'll now dive into other powerful customization features available in Subnet-EVM.

## Overview of Subnet-EVM

Subnet-EVM is Avalanche's customized version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, tailored to run on Avalanche L1s. It allows developers to deploy Solidity smart contracts with enhanced capabilities, benefiting from Avalanche's high throughput and low latency. Subnet-EVM enables more flexibility and performance optimizations compared to the standard EVM.

Beyond the Validator Manager functionality we've covered, Subnet-EVM provides additional customization options through precompiles, allowing you to extend your L1's capabilities even further.

## Precompiles

Precompiles are specialized smart contracts that execute native Go code within the EVM context. They act as a bridge between Solidity and lower-level functionalities, allowing for performance optimizations and access to features not available in Solidity alone.

### Default Precompiles in Subnet-EVM

Subnet-EVM comes with a set of default precompiles that extend the EVM's functionality:

- **AllowList**: Interface that manages access control by allowing or restricting specific addresses, inherited by all precompiles.
- **Deployer AllowList**: Restricts which addresses can deploy smart contracts.
- **Native Minter**: Manages the minting and burning of native tokens.
- **Transaction AllowList**: Controls which addresses can submit transactions.
- **Fee Manager**: Controls gas fee parameters and fee markets.
- **Reward Manager**: Handles the distribution of staking rewards to validators.
- **Warp Messenger**: Enables cross-chain communication between Avalanche L1s.

### Precompile Addresses and Configuration

If a precompile is enabled within the `genesis.json` using the respective `ConfigKey`, you can interact with the precompile using Foundry or other tools such as Remix.

Below are the addresses and `ConfigKey` values of default precompiles available in Subnet-EVM. The address and `ConfigKey` [are defined in the `module.go` of each precompile contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/tree/master/precompile/contracts).

| Precompile             | ConfigKey                         | Address                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Deployer AllowList     | `contractDeployerAllowListConfig` | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| Native Minter          | `contractNativeMinterConfig`      | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001` |
| Transaction AllowList  | `txAllowListConfig`               | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` |
| Fee Manager            | `feeManagerConfig`                | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003` |
| Reward Manager         | `rewardManagerConfig`             | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004` |
| Warp Messenger         | `warpConfig`                      | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000005` |

#### Example Interaction

For example, if `contractDeployerAllowListConfig` is enabled in the `genesis.json`:

```json title="genesis.json"
 "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
      "adminAddresses": [ // Addresses that can manage (add/remove) enabled addresses. They are also enabled themselves for contract deployment.
        "0x4f9e12d407b18ad1e96e4f139ef1c144f4058a4e",
        "0x4b9e5977a46307dd93674762f9ddbe94fb054def"
      ],
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "enabledAddresses": [
        "0x09c6fa19dd5d41ec6d0f4ca6f923ec3d941cc569" // Addresses that can only deploy contracts
      ]
    },
```

We can then add an `Enabled` address to the Deployer AllowList by interacting with the `IAllowList` interface at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000`:

```bash
cast send 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000 setEnabled(address addr) <ADDRESS_TO_ENABLE> --rpc-url $MY_L1_RPC --private-key $ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY
```
