title: Customize an Avalanche L1
description: Learn how to customize your EVM-powered Avalanche L1.
---

All Avalanche L1s can be customized by utilizing [`L1s Configs`](#avalanche-l1-configs).

an Avalanche L1 can have one or more blockchains. For example, the Primary Network, which is an Avalanche L1, a special one nonetheless, has 3 blockchains. Each chain can be further customized using chain specific configuration file. See [here](/docs/nodes/configure/configs-flags) for detailed explanation.

An Avalanche L1 created by or forked from [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) can be customized by utilizing one or more of the following methods:

- [Genesis](#genesis)
- [Precompile](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompile-upgrades)
- [Chain Configs](#avalanchego-chain-configs)

Avalanche L1 Configs[​](#avalanche-l1-configs "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------

an Avalanche L1 can customized by setting parameters for the following:

- [Validator-only communication to create a private Avalanche L1](/docs/nodes/configure/avalanche-l1-configs#validatoronly-bool)
- [Consensus](/docs/nodes/configure/avalanche-l1-configs#consensus-parameters)
- [Gossip](/docs/nodes/configure/avalanche-l1-configs#gossip-configs)

See [here](/docs/nodes/configure/avalanche-l1-configs) for more info.

Genesis[​](#genesis "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------

Each blockchain has some genesis state when it's created. Each Virtual Machine defines the format and semantics of its genesis data.

The default genesis Subnet-EVM provided below has some well defined parameters:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 43214,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip150Hash": "0x2086799aeebeae135c246c65021c82b4e15a2c451340993aacfd2751886514f0",
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,

      "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
    }
  },
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "timestamp": "0x0",
  "extraData": "0x00",
  "gasLimit": "0xe4e1c0",
  "difficulty": "0x0",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "number": "0x0",
  "gasUsed": "0x0",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Chain Config[​](#chain-config "Direct link to heading")

`chainID`: Denotes the ChainID of to be created chain. Must be picked carefully since a conflict with other chains can cause issues. One suggestion is to check with [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) to avoid ID collision, reserve and publish your ChainID properly.

You can use `eth_getChainConfig` RPC call to get the current chain config. See [here](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_getchainconfig) for more info.

#### Hard Forks[​](#hard-forks "Direct link to heading")

`homesteadBlock`, `eip150Block`, `eip150Hash`, `eip155Block`, `byzantiumBlock`, `constantinopleBlock`, `petersburgBlock`, `istanbulBlock`, `muirGlacierBlock` are EVM hard fork activation times. Changing these may cause issues, so treat them carefully.

#### Fee Config[​](#fee-config "Direct link to heading")

`gasLimit`: Sets the max amount of gas consumed per block. This restriction puts a cap on the amount of computation that can be done in a single block, which in turn sets a limit on the maximum gas usage allowed for a single transaction. For reference, C-Chain value is set to `15,000,000`.

`targetBlockRate`: Sets the target rate of block production in seconds. A target of 2 will target producing a block every 2 seconds. If the network starts producing blocks at a faster rate, it indicates that more blocks than anticipated are being issued to the network, resulting in an increase in base fees. For C-chain this value is set to `2`.

`minBaseFee`: Sets a lower bound on the EIP-1559 base fee of a block. Since the block's base fee sets the minimum gas price for any transaction included in that block, this effectively sets a minimum gas price for any transaction.

`targetGas`: Specifies the targeted amount of gas (including block gas cost) to consume within a rolling 10-seconds window. When the dynamic fee algorithm observes that network activity is above/below the `targetGas`, it increases/decreases the base fee proportionally to how far above/below the target actual network activity is. If the network starts producing blocks with gas cost higher than this, base fees are increased accordingly.

`baseFeeChangeDenominator`: Divides the difference between actual and target utilization to determine how much to increase/decrease the base fee. A larger denominator indicates a slower changing, stickier base fee, while a lower denominator allows the base fee to adjust more quickly. For reference, the C-chain value is set to `36`. This value sets the base fee to increase or decrease by a factor of `1/36` of the parent block's base fee.

`minBlockGasCost`: Sets the minimum amount of gas to charge for the production of a block. This value is set to `0` in C-Chain.

`maxBlockGasCost`: Sets the maximum amount of gas to charge for the production of a block.

`blockGasCostStep`: Determines how much to increase/decrease the block gas cost depending on the amount of time elapsed since the previous block.

If the block is produced at the target rate, the block gas cost will stay the same as the block gas cost for the parent block.

If it is produced faster/slower, the block gas cost will be increased/decreased by the step value for each second faster/slower than the target block rate accordingly.

<Callout title="Note">
If the `blockGasCostStep` is set to a very large number, it effectively requires block production to go no faster than the `targetBlockRate`. For example, if a block is produced two seconds faster than the target block rate, the block gas cost will increase by `2 * blockGasCostStep`.
</Callout>

#### Custom Fee Recipients[​](#custom-fee-recipients "Direct link to heading")

See section [Setting a Custom Fee Recipient](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient)

### Alloc[​](#alloc "Direct link to heading")

The fields `nonce`, `timestamp`, `extraData`, `gasLimit`, `difficulty`, `mixHash`, `coinbase`, `number`, `gasUsed`, `parentHash` defines the genesis block header. The field `gasLimit` should be set to match the `gasLimit` set in the `feeConfig`. You do not need to change any of the other genesis header fields.

`nonce`, `mixHash` and `difficulty` are remnant parameters from Proof of Work systems. For Avalanche, these don't play any relevant role, so you should just leave them as their default values:

`nonce`: The result of the mining process iteration is this value. It can be any value in the genesis block. Default value is `0x0`.

`mixHash`: The combination of `nonce` and `mixHash` allows to verify that the Block has really been cryptographically mined, thus, from this aspect, is valid. Default value is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

`difficulty`: The difficulty level applied during the nonce discovering process of this block. Default value is `0x0`.

`timestamp`: The timestamp of the creation of the genesis block. This is commonly set to `0x0`.

`extraData`: Optional extra data that can be included in the genesis block. This is commonly set to `0x`.

`gasLimit`: The total amount of gas that can be used in a single block. It should be set to the same value as in the [fee config](#fee-config). The value `e4e1c0` is hexadecimal and is equal to `15,000,000`.

`coinbase`: Refers to the address of the block producers. This also means it represents the recipient of the block reward. It is usually set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` for the genesis block. To allow fee recipients in Subnet-EVM, refer to [this section.](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient)

`parentHash`: This is the Keccak 256-bit hash of the entire parent block's header. It is usually set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` for the genesis block.

`gasUsed`: This is the amount of gas used by the genesis block. It is usually set to `0x0`.

`number`: This is the number of the genesis block. This required to be `0x0` for the genesis. Otherwise it will error.

### Genesis Examples[​](#genesis-examples "Direct link to heading")

Another example of a genesis file can be found in the [networks folder](https://github.com/ava-labs/public-chain-assets/blob/1951594346dcc91682bdd8929bcf8c1bf6a04c33/chains/11111/genesis.json). Please remove `airdropHash` and `airdropAmount` fields if you want to start with it.

Here are a few examples on how a genesis file is used: [scripts/run.sh](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/scripts/run.sh#L99)

### Setting the Genesis Allocation[​](#setting-the-genesis-allocation "Direct link to heading")

Alloc defines addresses and their initial balances. This should be changed accordingly for each chain. If you don't provide any genesis allocation, you won't be able to interact with your new chain (all transactions require a fee to be paid from the sender's balance).

The `alloc` field expects key-value pairs. Keys of each entry must be a valid `address`. The `balance` field in the value can be either a `hexadecimal` or `number` to indicate initial balance of the address. The default value contains `8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` with `50000000000000000000000000` balance in it. Default:

```json
"alloc": {
  "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
    "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
  }
}
```

To specify a different genesis allocation, populate the `alloc` field in the genesis JSON as follows:

```json
"alloc": {
  "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
    "balance": "0x52B7D2DCC80CD2E4000000"
  },
  "Ab5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B": {
    "balance": "0xa796504b1cb5a7c0000"
  }
},
```

The keys in the allocation are [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) addresses **without the canonical `0x` prefix**. The balances are denominated in Wei ([10^18 Wei = 1 Whole Unit of Native Token](https://eth-converter.com/)) and expressed as hex strings **with the canonical `0x` prefix**. You can use [this converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html) to translate between decimal and hex numbers.

The above example yields the following genesis allocations (denominated in whole units of the native token, that is 1 AVAX/1 WAGMI):

```bash
0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC: 100000000 (0x52B7D2DCC80CD2E4000000=100000000000000000000000000 Wei)
0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B: 49463 (0xa796504b1cb5a7c0000=49463000000000000000000 Wei)
```

### Setting a Custom Fee Recipient[​](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient "Direct link to heading")

By default, all fees are burned (sent to the black hole address with `"allowFeeRecipients": false`). However, it is possible to enable block producers to set a fee recipient (who will get compensated for blocks they produce).

To enable this feature, you'll need to add the following to your genesis file (under the `"config"` key):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "allowFeeRecipients": true
  }
}
```
