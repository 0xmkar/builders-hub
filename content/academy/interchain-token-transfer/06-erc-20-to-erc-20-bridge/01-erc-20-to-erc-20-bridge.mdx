## Transfer an ERC-20 Token &rarr; Avalanche L1 as an ERC-20 Token

This chapter will show you how to send an ERC-20 Token on <GlossaryTerm>Contract Chain</GlossaryTerm> to an <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm> using <GlossaryTerm>Interchain Messaging</GlossaryTerm> and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network, but can be applied to Fuji Testnet and Avalanche Mainnet directly.

**All Avalanche <GlossaryTerm>Interchain Token Transfer</GlossaryTerm> contracts and interfaces implemented in this chapter implementation are maintained in the [`avalanche-interchain-token-transfer`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The avalanche-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we will do

1. Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on Contract Chain
2. Deploy the Interchain Token Transfer Contracts on Contract Chain and Avalanche L1
3. Register Remote Token contract with the Home Transferer contract
4. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens
