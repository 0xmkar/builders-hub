A <GlossaryTerm>native token</GlossaryTerm> in a <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm> running the <GlossaryTerm>EVM</GlossaryTerm> refers to the primary digital currency or cryptocurrency native to the EVM blockchain. Every EVM layer 1 chain has it's own native token:

- <GlossaryTerm>Ethereum</GlossaryTerm>: ETH
- <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> <GlossaryTerm>C-Chain</GlossaryTerm>: AVAX
- Dexalot: ALOT
- many more...

The native token serves as both a means of value transfer within the EVM network and as the <GlossaryTerm>gas</GlossaryTerm> token for executing transfers or <GlossaryTerm>smart contract</GlossaryTerm>s. Therefore, native tokens play a crucial role in the EVM chain by enabling participants to interact with and utilize the platform's decentralized features, serving as the foundational unit of value.
