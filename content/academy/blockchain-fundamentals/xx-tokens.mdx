import GlossaryTerm from '@/components/ui/glossary-term'

<GlossaryTerm>Token</GlossaryTerm>s are a concept that existed in societies for a long time. 

<GlossaryTerm>Token</GlossaryTerm>s can be used to represent value. The most common valuable tokens we use every day are fiat currencies, like the US dollar. But there are also other kinds of <GlossaryTerm>token</GlossaryTerm>s, such as points or miles in loyalty programs. Today we can also tokenize other assets, such as property titles.

## <GlossaryTerm>Fungible Token</GlossaryTerm>s

Fungibility means that different <GlossaryTerm>token</GlossaryTerm>s can be considered of equal value. Let's take for example two one dollar bills. Most people will not care if they get one or the other. They both offer the same utility. 

## <GlossaryTerm>Non-Fungible Token</GlossaryTerm>s

<GlossaryTerm>Non-Fungible Token</GlossaryTerm>s are not considered equal. The most prominent use cases are Art-<GlossaryTerm>NFT</GlossaryTerm>s. While the <GlossaryTerm>token</GlossaryTerm>s may follow a standard of how they can be transfered, they may not be interchangeable. Two pieces of art may have very different values.
