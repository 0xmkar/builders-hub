## Moving from a centralized Entity to a Collective of Validators

<GlossaryTerm>Blockchain</GlossaryTerm> systems achieve decentralization through the use of a network of validators, sometimes referred to as nodes, miners, or stakers, depending on the underlying <GlossaryTerm>consensus</GlossaryTerm> mechanism. Validators are responsible for verifying and securing transactions, maintaining the integrity of the <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>, and ensuring that the system remains decentralized and trustless. Decentralization is achieved by distributing the responsibility of maintaining the network across numerous independent participants.

Decentralization in <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm> is achieved through a network of validators. These are independent entities that run the <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm> software, perform computations, and ensure the integrity of the <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>. Here's how it works:

Computation Execution: Each validator independently performs the same computation. For example, let's consider a simple computation: 5 + 3.
<GlossaryTerm>Consensus</GlossaryTerm> Process: After performing the computation, validators share their results with each other. They then use a process called <GlossaryTerm>consensus</GlossaryTerm> to agree on the correct result. You can think of it as a election, where all validators vote on the correct answer.
The <GlossaryTerm>consensus</GlossaryTerm> process ensures that all validators reach an agreement on the correct result, given that the majority is honest. This agreement is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the <GlossaryTerm>blockchain</GlossaryTerm>. If a validator tries to cheat or provide an incorrect result, the other validators will detect the discrepancy, and the cheating validator will be penalized.
