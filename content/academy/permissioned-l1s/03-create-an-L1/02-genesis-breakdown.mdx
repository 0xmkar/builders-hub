### What is a genesis file?

The genesis file defines the very first block of your Subnet-EVM chain and its initial state. It enables EVM features, sets economic parameters (fees and gas), fixes the start time, etc...

Additionally, in the context of Avalanche, it is **set by default to pre-deploy well-known contracts**. Lets take a look at which ones:

### Top-level fields (the header)

- **number/parentHash/mixHash/nonce**: Standard Ethereum-style genesis header fields. At genesis they’re zeroed to indicate no parent block.
- **timestamp**: `1754660049` (hex: `0x6895fcd1`). This is the chain start time in Unix seconds (UTC), around Aug/Sep 2025. Validators will not accept blocks before this time.
- **gasLimit**: `15,000,000` (hex: `0xe4e1c0`). Initial block gas limit; matches the configured per-block limit below.
- **coinbase**: Zero address. Not used for block rewards in Subnet-EVM; economic policy is configured separately.
- **difficulty**: `0`. Subnet-EVM uses Snowman++ consensus; PoW-style difficulty is irrelevant and set to zero.
- **extraData/baseFeePerGas/excessBlobGas/blobGasUsed/airdrop...**: Optional fields that are empty in this default. Subnet-EVM computes base fee using fee settings in `config.feeConfig` (see below), so `baseFeePerGas` can be omitted here.

### config: protocol features and economics

- **Fork activations**: `homesteadBlock`, `byzantiumBlock`, `constantinopleBlock`, `petersburgBlock`, `istanbulBlock`, `berlinBlock`, `londonBlock` are all `0`. This means all the corresponding EVM features are active from block 0.
- **chainId**: `94402`. Transactions on this chain must be signed with this chain ID (EIP-155 replay protection).

#### Fee configuration (Subnet-EVM specific)

The `feeConfig` governs gas prices and throughput targeting:

- **targetBlockRate**: `2` seconds. Intended average time between blocks.
- **gasLimit**: `15,000,000`. Per-block gas limit (should match top-level `gasLimit`).
- **targetGas**: `15,000,000`. Target gas usage per block. The base fee will trend so that average gas used approaches this target.
- **minBaseFee**: `25,000,000,000` wei (25 gwei). Base fee will never drop below this.
- **baseFeeChangeDenominator**: `48`. Caps per‑block base fee adjustment to about 1/48 ≈ 2.08% up or down, smoothing price swings.
- **blockGasCostStep / minBlockGasCost / maxBlockGasCost**: Controls an internal “block gas cost” heuristic used by Subnet‑EVM to stabilize throughput with the target block rate. The value moves in steps of `200,000` within `[0, 1,000,000]` as the system reacts to demand.

Together, these parameters make fees predictable: if blocks are consistently full, base fee rises toward an equilibrium; if blocks are empty, it falls but not below `minBaseFee`.

#### Warp messaging configuration

Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) lets chains trustlessly send messages to each other.

- **warpConfig.blockTimestamp**: `1754660049` — earliest time when Warp verification is considered active on this chain (matches the genesis timestamp).
- **warpConfig.requirePrimaryNetworkSigners**: `true` — Warp proofs must be signed by the Primary Network validator set.
- **warpConfig.quorumNumerator**: `67` — 67% signature threshold (by stake) required for Warp message validity.

### alloc: preloaded balances and predeploys

The `alloc` section seeds balances and deploys bytecode at fixed addresses before block 0, so they exist from the first block.

- **0x529e69f386fa75a06b595f721433f1a10b5dD151**
  - Balance: `0xd3c21bcecceda1000000` wei = 1,000,000 native tokens (1e6 × 1e18). Useful as a funded deployer/faucet account in devnets.

- **0xfacade0000000000000000000000000000000000** — TransparentUpgradeableProxy (predeployed proxy)
  - Code: Proxy bytecode that delegates calls to an implementation and is controlled by an admin.
  - Storage slots (EIP‑1967):
    - `0x3608…bbc` (implementation): `0x1212121212121212121212121212121212121212` (placeholder implementation address; can be upgraded later).
    - `0xb531…103` (admin): `0xdad0000000000000000000000000000000000000` (the Proxy Admin address below).

- **0xdad0000000000000000000000000000000000000** — Proxy Admin (Ownable)
  - Owns and manages upgrades of the proxy at `0xfacade…` (typical OpenZeppelin‑style admin with `upgradeTo`, `changeAdmin`, etc.).

- **0x914d7fEc6AaC8cD542e72bcA78B30650D45643D7** — CREATE2 Deployer
  - Minimal factory used for deterministic deployments via `CREATE2`. Many tools expect this address for reproducible addresses.

- **0xCa11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976CA11** — Multicall3
  - Standard utility to batch multiple read calls into one RPC request and to perform aggregate calls.

- **0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111** — Wrapped Native Token (WNT)
  - ERC‑20 wrapper for the native token of this Subnet. Storage shows name “Wrapped Native Token” and symbol “WNT”.
  - Users can deposit native token to receive WNT and withdraw to unwrap.

- **0x253b2784c75E510Dd0Ff1Da844684a1aC0Aa5fCF** — Teleporter Messenger (AWM)
  - Core messaging contract for Avalanche Warp Messaging; handles sending/verification and accounting of cross‑chain messages.

- **0x13B0d85ccB8Bf860B6B79Af3029fcA081Ae9bEF2** — Teleporter Manager/Router (AWM)
  - Higher‑level management around Teleporter (message queues, fees, guards). Bytecode strings reference `TeleporterMessenger`, reentrancy guards, and SafeERC20 operations.

These addresses are human‑readable or widely recognized (e.g., `facade…`, `dad…`, `ca11bde…`, `0x1111…`) to make them easy to memorize and to avoid collisions.

### Practical takeaways

- You can immediately use WNT at `0x1111…` and Multicall3 at `0xca11…` in tooling.
- Upgradable app logic can be wired by upgrading the proxy at `0xfacade…` via the admin `0xdad…` to point to a real implementation.
- Cross‑chain messaging is ready out‑of‑the‑box through the Teleporter contracts, verified by Primary Network signers with a 67% quorum.
- Fees start at ≥ 25 gwei and adjust gradually (~2.08% cap per block) toward stable 2‑second blocks at ~15M gas.

If you want to customize behavior, you typically edit `config.feeConfig`, `config.warpConfig`, or the `alloc` section (e.g., fund more accounts, predeploy app contracts) and regenerate your genesis.
