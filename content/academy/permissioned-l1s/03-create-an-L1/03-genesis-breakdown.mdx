### What is a genesis file?

The genesis file defines the very first block of your Subnet-EVM chain and its initial state. It enables EVM features, sets economic parameters (fees and gas), fixes the start time, etc...

Additionally, in the context of Avalanche, it is **set by default to pre-deploy well-known contracts**. Lets take a look at which ones:

## Predeployed Contracts & Allocation

The `alloc` section seeds balances and deploys bytecode at fixed addresses before block 0, so they exist from the first block. 

Additional contracts are also deployed by default (*multicall3, create2, wrapped native tokens...*), but we will not dive into them in this guide as they are not essential for understanding permissioned L1s.

- **BLOCKCHAIN_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS** - Subnet Owner Balance: `0xd3c21bcecceda1000000` wei = 1,000,000 native tokens (1e6 × 1e18) useful for funded deployer/faucet account

- **TransparentUpgradeableProxy** *(0xfacade00...00)* — Proxy bytecode that delegates calls to an implementation and is controlled by an admin. Storage slots (EIP‑1967) predefined in the contract:
    - `0x3608…bbc` (implementation): `0x1212121212121212121212121212121212121212` (placeholder implementation address)
    - `0xb531…103` (admin): `0xdad0000000000000000000000000000000000000` (the Proxy Admin address below).

- **Proxy Admin** *(0xdad00...00)* — Owns and manages upgrades of the proxy at `0xfacade…`

### Why Pre-Deploy Proxy Contracts

The proxy at `0xfacade…` must be deployed **before** the `convertSubnetToL1` transaction because the transaction itself requires the Validator Manager address as a parameter:

```solidity
type ConvertSubnetToL1Tx struct {
    // ...other fields...
    // Address of the Subnet manager (the proxy at 0xfacade...)
    Address types.JSONByteSlice `serialize:"true" json:"address"`
}
```

The proxy will later be upgraded to point to the actual VMC implementation after conversion, but more on this in the [Validator Manager Deployment](/academy/permissioned-l1s/04-validator-manager-deployment/01-vmc-deployment-intro) section

Additionally, the `convertSubnetToL1` process has limited transaction capacity during conversion. By predeploying proxy contracts, we ensure that essential infrastructure is available immediately after conversion without needing to deploy them in the constrained environment.

## Key Takeaways

- **Proxy at `0xfacade…`** is the Validator Manager address required by `convertSubnetToL1` - must exist before conversion
- **ProxyAdmin at `0xdad…`** controls upgrades to wire the actual VMC implementation post-conversion
- **Utility contracts** (CREATE2, Multicall3, WNT) provide essential blockchain functionality from genesis
- **Predeployment strategy** overcomes transaction capacity limits during subnet-to-L1 conversion
