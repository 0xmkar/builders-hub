### What is a genesis file?

The genesis file defines the very first block of your Subnet-EVM chain and its initial state. It enables EVM features, sets economic parameters (fees and gas), fixes the start time, etc...

Additionally, in the context of Avalanche, it is **set by default to pre-deploy well-known contracts**. Lets take a look at which ones:

#### Warp messaging configuration - REWORD

Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) lets chains trustlessly send messages to each other.

- **warpConfig.blockTimestamp**: `1754660049` — earliest time when Warp verification is considered active on this chain (matches the genesis timestamp).
- **warpConfig.requirePrimaryNetworkSigners**: `true` — Warp proofs must be signed by the Primary Network validator set.
- **warpConfig.quorumNumerator**: `67` — 67% signature threshold (by stake) required for Warp message validity.

## Predeployed Contracts & Allocation

The `alloc` section seeds balances and deploys bytecode at fixed addresses before block 0, so they exist from the first block.

- **BLOCKCHAIN_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS** - Subnet Owner Balance: `0xd3c21bcecceda1000000` wei = 1,000,000 native tokens (1e6 × 1e18) useful for funded deployer/faucet account

- **TransparentUpgradeableProxy** *(0xfacade00...00)* — Proxy bytecode that delegates calls to an implementation and is controlled by an admin. Storage slots (EIP‑1967) predefined in the contract:
    - `0x3608…bbc` (implementation): `0x1212121212121212121212121212121212121212` (placeholder implementation address)
    - `0xb531…103` (admin): `0xdad0000000000000000000000000000000000000` (the Proxy Admin address below).

- **Proxy Admin** *(0xdad00...00)* — Owns and manages upgrades of the proxy at `0xfacade…`

- **CREATE2 Deployer** *(0x914d7fEc6AaC8cD542e72bcA78B30650D45643D7)* — Minimal factory used for deterministic deployments (reproducible addresses across chains)

- **Multicall3** *(0xCa11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976CA11)* —  used to batch multiple read calls into one RPC request and to perform aggregate calls

- **Wrapped Native Token (WNT)** *(0x111...111)* — ERC‑20 wrapper for the native token of this Subnet so users can deposit native token to receive WNT and withdraw to unwrap.

- **ICM contracts (Teleporter)** *(0x253b2784c75E510Dd0Ff1Da844684a1aC0Aa5fCF)* — Core messaging contract for Avalanche Warp Messaging; handles sending/verification and accounting of cross‑chain messages.

- **ICM (Teleporter Manager/Router AWM)** *(0x13B0d85ccB8Bf860B6B79Af3029fcA081Ae9bEF2)* — Higher‑level management around Teleporter (message queues, fees, guards). Bytecode strings reference `TeleporterMessenger`, reentrancy guards, and SafeERC20 operations.

### Key Takeaways

- You can immediately use WNT at `0x1111…` and Multicall3 at `0xca11…` in tooling.
- Cross‑chain messaging is ready out‑of‑the‑box through the ICM contracts (teleporter).
- Upgradable app logic can be wired by upgrading the proxy at `0xfacade…` via the admin `0xdad…` to point to a real implementation.
