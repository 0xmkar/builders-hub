## Overview

After deploying the proxy contract, you need to deploy the actual Validator Manager implementation that contains the logic for managing validators.

## Implementation Contract

The Validator Manager implementation:
- Contains all validator management logic
- Implements the ACP99Manager standard
- Handles P-Chain communication
- Can be upgraded without losing state

## Deploy the Implementation

<ConnectButton />

<L1ValidatorManager activeTab="deployImplementation" />

### Deployment Parameters

When deploying, you'll need to provide:

1. **Proxy Address**: The proxy contract you deployed earlier
2. **Implementation Type**: Usually the standard ValidatorManager
3. **Network Configuration**: Ensure correct network selection

## Post-Deployment Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Verify Deployment**: Check the implementation address
2. **Link to Proxy**: The proxy must point to this implementation
3. **Initialize**: Set up initial configuration (next section)
4. **Verify Functionality**: Test basic read operations

<Callout type="info">
The implementation contract itself doesn't hold state - all state is stored in the proxy. This separation is what enables upgradeability.
</Callout>

## Implementation Details

### Contract Structure

```solidity
contract ValidatorManager is ACP99Manager, OwnableUpgradeable {
    // Core validator management functions
    function initiateValidatorRegistration(...) external onlyOwner
    function completeValidatorRegistration(...) external
    // ... more functions
}
```

### Key Functions

- **Initiate functions**: Start validator operations (owner only)
- **Complete functions**: Finalize operations after P-Chain confirmation
- **Query functions**: Read validator information
- **Admin functions**: Manage contract parameters

## Common Issues

### Deployment Failures

- **Insufficient gas**: Increase gas limit for deployment
- **Wrong network**: Verify you're on the intended chain
- **Proxy mismatch**: Ensure proxy is compatible

### Post-Deployment Issues

- **Not initialized**: Remember to initialize after deployment
- **Wrong owner**: Check ownership is set correctly
- **Proxy not linked**: Verify proxy points to implementation

## Security Best Practices

1. **Verify source code**: Ensure using official implementations
2. **Check permissions**: Verify owner and admin roles
3. **Test thoroughly**: Use testnet before mainnet
4. **Monitor events**: Watch for unexpected behavior

## Next Steps

With the implementation deployed:
1. Upgrade the proxy to point to your implementation
2. Initialize the Validator Manager with your L1's parameters
3. Set up initial validator configuration
4. Begin managing your validator set
