Now that you understand where to deploy your Validator Manager Contract (VMC), and you created Subnet with at least one validator node (**link create a subnet**) it's time to convert your Subnet into a sovereign L1. This process establishes the VMC as the authority for validator management on your blockchain.

## Conversion Process

The conversion from Subnet to L1 is a one-time, irreversible process that:

- **Establishes Sovereignty**: Your blockchain becomes independent with its own validator set
- **Transfers Authority**: Validator management shifts from P-Chain to your VMC
- **Removes Subnet Owner Privileges**: You lose the ability to modify the Subnet directly

</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Key Parameters

### Subnet ID
The unique identifier of your Subnet (from the `CreateSubnetTx` transaction hash).

### Validator Manager Blockchain ID
The blockchain where your VMC is deployed:
- **Your L1**: Use your own blockchain ID (if VMC is deployed there)
- **C-Chain**: Use `2q9e4r6Mu3Uqs6mSMLHh8v6pK5mKqE8nN` (Avalanche C-Chain)
- **Another L1**: Use the specific blockchain ID

### Validator Manager Address
The deployed proxy contract address of your VMC.

### Initial Validators
The validators that will form your L1's initial validator set. These must be:
- Currently validating your Subnet
- Have sufficient stake (if applicable)
- Be approved by your VMC's permissioning rules

## Post-Conversion Changes

After successful conversion:

1. **Validator Management**: All validator operations go through your VMC
2. **P-Chain Communication**: VMC handles all P-Chain interactions via ICM
3. **Sovereignty**: Your L1 operates independently with its own governance
4. **No Rollback**: The conversion cannot be undone

<Callout type="warning">
**Irreversible Process**: Once converted to L1, you cannot revert to Subnet status. Ensure your VMC is properly configured before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

After conversion, you'll need to:
1. **Deploy VMC** (if not already done)
2. **Configure Initial Validators** through your VMC
3. **Test Validator Operations** to ensure everything works correctly

The following sections will guide you through deploying and configuring your Validator Manager Contract.
