## Overview

The Validator Manager uses the proxy pattern for upgradeability. This allows you to update the implementation while preserving the contract state and address.

## Why Use a Proxy?

1. **Upgradeability**: Fix bugs or add features without losing state
2. **Consistent Address**: The contract address never changes
3. **Storage Persistence**: Validator data remains intact through upgrades
4. **Future-Proofing**: Adapt to protocol changes without disruption

## Understanding the Proxy Pattern

The proxy pattern separates storage from logic:

```
User → Proxy Contract → Implementation Contract
         (storage)           (logic)
```

### Key Components

1. **Proxy Contract**: Holds the state and delegates calls
2. **Implementation**: Contains the actual Validator Manager logic
3. **Admin**: Can upgrade the implementation address

### How Upgrades Work

1. Deploy new implementation contract
2. Call upgrade function on proxy
3. Proxy now delegates to new implementation
4. All state remains in the proxy

## Deploy the Proxy

Use the toolbox below to deploy your proxy contract:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <DeployProxyContract />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Save your proxy contract address! This is the permanent address for your Validator Manager, regardless of implementation upgrades.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

- **Admin Key**: Protect the admin account that can upgrade
- **Implementation Verification**: Always verify new implementations
- **Upgrade Testing**: Test upgrades on testnet first
- **Time Delays**: Consider using timelocks for upgrades
