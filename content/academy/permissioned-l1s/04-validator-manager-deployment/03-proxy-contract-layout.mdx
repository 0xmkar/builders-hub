## Overview

The Validator Manager uses the proxy pattern for upgradeability. This allows you to update the implementation while preserving the contract state and address.

## Why Use a Proxy?

1. **Upgradeability**: Fix bugs or add features without losing state
2. **Consistent Address**: The contract address never changes
3. **Storage Persistence**: Validator data remains intact through upgrades
4. **Future-Proofing**: Adapt to protocol changes without disruption

## Understanding the Proxy Pattern

The proxy pattern separates storage from logic:

```
User → Proxy Contract → Implementation Contract
         (storage)           (logic)
```

### Key Components

1. **Proxy Contract**: Holds the state and delegates calls
2. **Implementation**: Contains the actual Validator Manager logic
3. **Admin**: Can upgrade the implementation address

### How Upgrades Work

1. Deploy new implementation contract
2. Call upgrade function on proxy
3. Proxy now delegates to new implementation
4. All state remains in the proxy
