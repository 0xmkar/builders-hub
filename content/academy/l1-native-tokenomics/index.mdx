Welcome to the **L1 Native Tokenomics** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of how to create and manage native tokens on your own Avalanche L1 blockchain. By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in designing tokenomics, configuring native token allocation, and leveraging precompiles to create powerful token economies.

## Course Content

### Welcome to the Course
Work in a summary of this [L1 Economics blog post](https://build.avax.network/blog/l1-economics) which lays out what type of business case scenarios will require you to have an L1 native token, and when not to, and hints at some of the stuff we will see (transaction fees).

### Tokens 101
Learn the fundamentals of different token types, including ERC20 standardization for DeFi, native tokens across various protocols, wrapped tokens, and how token decimals affect transactions and supply.

### Custom Native Tokens
Explore how to create custom native tokens on your L1, understand the differences between native and ERC20 tokens, and learn how to configure native token allocation effectively.

### Precompiles
Dive deep into what precompiles are, how they integrate with the protocol layer, and understand the function flow for interacting with them from the dev console or other tools.

### Native Minter Precompile
Master the Native Minter Precompile, including genesis configuration, minting rights management, and understanding when to use it versus when it's not needed.

### Fee Config Precompile
Learn to configure transaction fees using the Fee Config Precompile, understanding how different configurations affect your native token's economics and supply dynamics.

### Setting the Foundation
Break down the genesis configuration concepts, including activating precompiles, setting up fee configurations, and preparing for cross-chain functionality.

### Token Distribution / Reward Manager Precompile
Understand what happens with transaction fees, how to implement vesting contracts, bonding curves, airdrops, and effective token distribution strategies.

### Governance
Study governance models, DAOs, quadratic voting, and the latest innovations in governance (Governance 2.0) for decentralized decision-making on your L1.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

### Basic Understanding of Blockchain
This course is for people with some blockchain knowledge. Check out this [guide](/guides/what-is-a-blockchain) to review what a blockchain is.

### Avalanche Fundamentals
This course is intended for people with knowledge about Avalanche architecture and basic concepts. You should be familiar with:

1. **Avalanche Architecture**: Be familiar with Avalanche blockchains and how they work.
2. **L1 Creation**: Understand how to create and deploy your own L1 blockchain.

If some of this is not clear, we strongly recommend taking the **Avalanche Fundamentals** course first.

### Software Development
You will need a general understanding of Software Development. While you won't have to write a lot of code, you will need to understand some concepts. Therefore, we recommend:

1. **Solidity**: Basic knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces.
2. **Foundry**: Familiarity with Foundry will help you deploy and interact with contracts.
3. **Genesis Configuration**: Understanding how to configure blockchain parameters.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- **Understand Token Fundamentals**: Gain deep insights into what tokens are, their differences, and the implications of creating native tokens versus ERC20 tokens.
- **Master Native Token Creation**: Learn how to create custom native tokens and understand when you need them versus when ERC20 tokens are sufficient.
- **Leverage Precompiles**: Understand how to use the Native Minter and Fee Config Precompiles to create powerful tokenomics.
- **Configure Token Economics**: Master fee configurations for fast chains, slow chains, and understand how this impacts your native token's supply dynamics.
- **Design Token Distribution**: Create effective vesting schedules, bonding curves, and airdrop strategies for your native tokens.
- **Implement Governance**: Develop governance structures including DAOs and quadratic voting models for decentralized decision-making.

## Course Structure

This course combines theory with hands-on practice:

- **[T] Theory Sessions**: Deep dives into concepts, precompiles, and tokenomics principles
- **[P] Practice Exercises**: Hands-on work using the dev console and toolbox to deploy and configure tokens

## Why L1 Native Tokens?

Unlike ERC20 tokens that exist on existing blockchains, L1 native tokens give you complete control over your token's economics, security, and utility. This course will show you how Avalanche's unique architecture enables you to create tokens that are deeply integrated with your blockchain's protocol layer, offering advantages that simply aren't possible with traditional token standards.
