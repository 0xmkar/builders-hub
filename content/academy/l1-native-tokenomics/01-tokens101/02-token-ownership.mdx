## Notes

In the fast-evolving landscape of digital finance and blockchain technology, one term gaining widespread attention is “tokenization.” But what exactly is tokenization, and why is it considered the cornerstone of the digital asset revolution? Let’s break it down.

In an increasingly digital world, the concept of tokenization is revolutionizing the way we perceive and interact with assets across various sectors. 

Ethereum’s ICO was indeed a significant moment in history where capital was globally coordinated towards a common goal, without relying on a trusted intermediary, to finance the development of a project and receive a digital representation of ownership in return: Ether or ETH. It is worth pointing out that ETH was only a commodity then, used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, and not necessarily intended as an investment vehicle ; although humans have a tendency to speculate on many things…

A decade later, we can look back at Bitcoin as the first successful answer to two significant challenges of the internet:

provable digital scarcity and thus provable digital ownership, enforced by code only and not by law. Until then, ownership was only enforceable by nations, violence, and laws — more here.
Coordination of a global network of humans and machines that obey simple rules, where code is law, where incentive-mechanisms rule, and where no assumption of honesty or altruism from participants is made.
