In many networks, such as <GlossaryTerm>Ethereum</GlossaryTerm>, the same token is used for both <GlossaryTerm>Staking</GlossaryTerm> and paying for <GlossaryTerm>Gas</GlossaryTerm>. However, in the <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche</GlossaryTerm> network, staking tokens and gas tokens can be separated, as they fulfill different purposes within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Staking Tokens

Staking tokens are used for securing public, permissionless <GlossaryTerm>Avalanche L1</GlossaryTerm>s through a <GlossaryTerm>Proof of Stake</GlossaryTerm> consensus mechanism. Holders of staking tokens can:

- Run <GlossaryTerm>Validator</GlossaryTerm>s
- Participate in the <GlossaryTerm>Consensus</GlossaryTerm> process by staking a certain amount of tokens as collateral

Validators propose and validate new blocks on your L1 blockchain. Staking tokens play a crucial role in:

- Maintaining network security
- Incentivizing validator participation

### Private Avalanche L1s

Not all Avalanche L1s are public and permissionless. Many enterprises choose a **Proof-of-Authority** setup, where the validators are selected by the enterprise. These blockchains do not require a staking token.
