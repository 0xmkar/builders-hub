Foundry serves as a comprehensive toolchain for smart contract development. It handles dependency management, project compilation, testing, deployment, and facilitates interaction with the blockchain through both command-line interface and Solidity scripts. 

In this course we will mainly use three commands:

- **forge create:** Deploying smart contracts
- **cast send:** Issuing transactions interacting with a smart contract
- **cast call:** Read-only operations on the blockchain

Let's look at these three in a little more detail for this example contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NumberStorage {
 
    uint256 num;
  
    function getNum() public view returns(uint) {
        return num; 
    }
  
    function setNum(uint _num) public {
        num = _num;
    }
  
}
```

## Private Key Management

To interact with smart contracts on Avalanche's C-Chain, you'll need:
1. A wallet with a private key
2. Test tokens to pay for transaction fees

### Creating Your Wallet

We'll use Foundry's built-in wallet management system to create and manage our keys securely:

```bash
# Create a new wallet named 'my-avalanche-wallet'
cast wallet new my-avalanche-wallet
```

This will create a new wallet and show you both the address and private key. The wallet will be stored securely in `~/.foundry/wallets/my-avalanche-wallet`.

To get your wallet's address for the faucet:
```bash
cast wallet address my-avalanche-wallet
```

To use the wallet's private key in commands:
```bash
--private-key $(cast wallet private-key my-avalanche-wallet)
```

### Getting Test Tokens

Before deploying contracts or sending transactions on Fuji testnet, you'll need test tokens. You can get these from:

1. [Fuji C-Chain Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) - For test AVAX on the C-Chain
2. [Dispatch Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=dispatch&token=dispatch) - For test AVAX on Dispatch

To use the faucets:
1. Copy your wallet address (using `cast wallet address my-avalanche-wallet`)
2. Visit the faucet links above and paste your address
3. Request tokens (there might be a cooldown period between requests)
4. Wait for the tokens to arrive in your wallet

You can check your balance with:
```bash
cast balance $(cast wallet address my-avalanche-wallet) --rpc-url https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

> Remember: These are testnet tokens with no real value, only used for development and testing purposes.

## Using Foundry Commands

### forge create

This command can be used to deploy smart contracts from a solidity file. The syntax is:

```bash
forge create [options] contract
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK src/my-contracts/NumberStorage.sol:NumberStorage 
```

Let's look at the different parameters:

- **--rpc-url:** The URL of the RPC server that the transaction will be sent to. Every blockchain can have multiple RPC servers.
- **--private-key:** The private key that will be used for signing the transaction for the smart contract deployment
- **contract:** The path to the contract is in the format `<path>:<contract>`, e.g. src/Contract.sol:Contract. A single solidity file can contain multiple contracts, therefore we have to also specify the contract name and not only the path to the file here.

### cast send

When we want to sign and publish a transaction we will use cast send. We can either issue simple value transfers or call smart contracts. The syntax is:

```bash
cast send [options] to [sig] [args…]
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK 0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25 "setNum(uint)" 42
```

Let's look at the different parameters:
- **--rpc-url:** See above
- **--private-key:** See above
- **to:** address of an account or a smart contract
- **sig:** The function signature of a function of the smart contract, e.g. "setNum(uint)"
- **args:** The arguments of that function (can be multiple or none)

### cast call

Call a read-only function of a smart contract. We do not have to issue a transaction for reading state from the blockchain, since the state won't change. Therefore we don't have to pay for a transaction and don't need a private key. The syntax is:

```bash
cast call [options] to sig [args…]
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url fuji-c 0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25 "getNum()(uint)"
```

Let's look at the different parameters:
- **--rpc-url:** See above
- **to:** address of an account or a smart contract
- **sig:** The function signature of a function of the smart contract, e.g. "getNum()(uint)". In this example our function does not have any arguments and returns a single value of type uint.
- **args:** The arguments of that function (can be multiple or none)
