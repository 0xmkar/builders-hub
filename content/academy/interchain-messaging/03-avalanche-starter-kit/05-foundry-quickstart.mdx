Foundry serves as our primary toolchain for smart contract development in this course. It handles dependency management, project compilation, testing, deployment, and facilitates interaction with the blockchain through both command-line interface and Solidity scripts.

## Wallet Management

To interact with smart contracts on Avalanche's networks, you'll need:
1. A wallet with a private key
2. Test tokens to pay for transaction fees

### Creating Your Wallet

We'll use Foundry's built-in wallet management system:

```bash
# Create a new wallet
cast wallet new
```

You'll receive output like:
```
Address:     0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Private key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update your `.env` file with your wallet information:
```bash
# Your private key (starts with 0x...)
PK=your_private_key_here
# Your wallet address (starts with 0x...)
FUNDED_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_here
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
> - Never commit your `.env` file or share your private key
> - Store your private key securely as backup
> - The example values above are for demonstration only

### Getting Test Tokens

Before deploying contracts or sending transactions, you'll need test tokens from:

1. [Fuji C-Chain Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) - For test AVAX on the C-Chain
2. [Dispatch Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=dispatch&token=dispatch) - For test AVAX on Dispatch

Check your balances:
```bash
# Check C-Chain balance
cast balance $FUNDED_ADDRESS --rpc-url fuji-c

# Check Dispatch balance
cast balance $FUNDED_ADDRESS --rpc-url fuji-dispatch
```

## Using Foundry Commands

### Deploying Smart Contracts

Deploy to either network using `forge create`:

```bash
# Deploy to Fuji C-Chain
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c \
  --private-key $PK \
  src/contracts/YourContract.sol:YourContract

# Deploy to Dispatch
forge create --rpc-url fuji-dispatch \
  --private-key $PK \
  src/contracts/YourContract.sol:YourContract
```

### Sending Transactions

Use `cast send` to make state-changing calls:

```bash
# On Fuji C-Chain
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c \
  --private-key $PK \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "functionName(uint256)" 123

# On Dispatch
cast send --rpc-url fuji-dispatch \
  --private-key $PK \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "functionName(uint256)" 123
```

### Reading Contract State

Use `cast call` for read-only operations:

```bash
# On Fuji C-Chain
cast call --rpc-url fuji-c \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "functionName()(uint256)"

# On Dispatch
cast call --rpc-url fuji-dispatch \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "functionName()(uint256)"
```

## Cross-Chain Development Notes

When developing cross-chain applications:

1. The Teleporter Registry is pre-deployed at `0x253b2784c75e510dD0fF1da844684a1aC0aa5fcf` on both networks
2. Always use the correct RPC URLs:
   - Fuji C-Chain: `fuji-c`
   - Dispatch: `fuji-dispatch`
3. Store contract addresses after deployment for future interactions
4. Test cross-chain messaging with small amounts first
