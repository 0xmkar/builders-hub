Foundry serves as a comprehensive toolchain for smart contract development. It handles dependency management, project compilation, testing, deployment, and facilitates interaction with the blockchain through both command-line interface and Solidity scripts. 

In this course we will mainly use three commands:

- **forge create:** Deploying smart contracts
- **cast send:** Issuing transactions interacting with a smart contract
- **cast call:** Read-only operations on the blockchain

Let's look at these three in a little more detail for this example contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NumberStorage {
 
    uint256 num;
  
    function getNum() public view returns(uint) {
        return num; 
    }
  
    function setNum(uint _num) public {
        num = _num;
    }
  
}
```

## Private Key Management

To interact with smart contracts on the testnet, you'll need:
1. A private key from your Core Wallet
2. Test tokens to pay for transaction fees

### Getting Your Private Key

You can get your private key from Core Wallet. However, remember to:
- Never share your private key with anyone
- Never commit it to version control
- Use environment variables to store it securely

Once you have your private key, you can store it in an environment variable:

```bash
export PK=your_private_key_here
```

Then you can use it in your Foundry commands with:

```bash
--private-key $PK
```

### Getting Test Tokens

Before deploying contracts or sending transactions, you'll need test tokens. You can get these from the following faucets:

1. For Fuji C-Chain (AVAX): [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c)
2. For Dispatch Testnet: [Dispatch Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=dispatch&token=dispatch)

To use the faucets:
1. Connect your Core Wallet
2. Request tokens (there might be a cooldown period between requests)
3. Wait for the tokens to arrive in your wallet

> Remember: These are testnet tokens with no real value, only used for development and testing purposes.

## Using Foundry Commands

### forge create

This command can be used to deploy smart contracts from a solidity file. The syntax is:

```bash
forge create [options] contract
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK src/my-contracts/NumberStorage.sol:NumberStorage 
```

Let's look at the different parameters:

- **--rpc-url:** The URL of the RPC server that the transaction will be sent to. Every blockchain can have multiple RPC servers.
- **--private-key:** The private key that will be used for signing the transaction for the smart contract deployment
- **contract:** The path to the contract is in the format `<path>:<contract>`, e.g. src/Contract.sol:Contract. A single solidity file can contain multiple contracts, therefore we have to also specify the contract name and not only the path to the file here.

### cast send

When we want to sign and publish a transaction we will use cast send. We can either issue simple value transfers or call smart contracts. The syntax is:

```bash
cast send [options] to [sig] [args…]
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK 0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25 "setNum(uint)" 42
```

Let's look at the different parameters:
- **--rpc-url:** See above
- **--private-key:** See above
- **to:** address of an account or a smart contract
- **sig:** The function signature of a function of the smart contract, e.g. "setNum(uint)"
- **args:** The arguments of that function (can be multiple or none)

### cast call

Call a read-only function of a smart contract. We do not have to issue a transaction for reading state from the blockchain, since the state won't change. Therefore we don't have to pay for a transaction and don't need a private key. The syntax is:

```bash
cast call [options] to sig [args…]
```

An example usage could look something like this:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url fuji-c 0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25 "getNum()(uint)"
```

Let's look at the different parameters:
- **--rpc-url:** See above
- **to:** address of an account or a smart contract
- **sig:** The function signature of a function of the smart contract, e.g. "getNum()(uint)". In this example our function does not have any arguments and returns a single value of type uint.
- **args:** The arguments of that function (can be multiple or none)
