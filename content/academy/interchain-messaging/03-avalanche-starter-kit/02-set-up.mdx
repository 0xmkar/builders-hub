The Avalanche Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Avalanche. The kit provides a self-contained environment with Foundry so you can follow the course without the need of installing anything else other than launching the environment.

In this course we will run the Avalanche Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the quickest way to get started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Set Up Avalanche Starter Kit:

### Create a Codespace
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=interchain-messaging&repo=769886086&machine=standardLinux32gb)

The Codespace will open in a new tab. You must be logged into a GitHub account, otherwise codespaces will not be available. Wait a few minutes until it's fully built. Alternatively, you can also clone the repo:

<Link
    href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit/tree/interchain-messaging"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Avalanche Starter Kit</Link>

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

![](/common-images/avalanche-starter-kit/new-terminal.png)

Now enter forge --version to verify everything is working:

```bash
forge --version
```

As a result you should see the version of Forge installed:

```
forge 0.2.0 (...)
```

If you see this output, Foundry is properly installed and you're ready to start developing smart contracts.

</Step>
<Step>

### Optional: Open Codespace locally in Visual Studio Code

You can switch any time from the browser IDE to Visual Studio Code:

The first time you switch, you will be asked to install the [Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) and connect VS Code to you GitHub account, if it is not already connceted.
