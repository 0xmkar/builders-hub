## Building a Structured GTM Framework

An effective GTM strategy for Web3 follows a structured approach that helps you systematically identify, reach, and convert your target customers.

### The Six-Step Framework

1. **Identify your target company types**
   - Look for organizations that would benefit most from blockchain technology
   - Consider both crypto-native and traditional companies exploring Web3
   - Focus on sectors where trust and transparency add significant value

2. **Define specific target roles within those companies**
   - CEOs and C-suite executives who make strategic decisions
   - Technical teams who evaluate implementation feasibility
   - Product managers who identify blockchain use cases
   - Innovation teams exploring emerging technologies

3. **Leverage founder networks for initial client acquisition**
   - Personal connections often provide the first opportunities
   - Former colleagues understand your credibility
   - Industry contacts can make warm introductions

> Using your connections is important in order to get the first clients.

4. **Build success stories that can be documented and replicated**
   - Focus on measurable outcomes from early implementations
   - Document the process, challenges, and solutions
   - Create case studies that resonate with similar prospects

5. **Develop a clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**
   - Company size and industry
   - Technical sophistication level
   - Budget and decision-making process
   - Pain points that blockchain can address

6. **Scale through dedicated sales teams once initial traction is achieved**
   - Hire when you have proven product-market fit
   - Look for sales talent with industry connections
   - Provide them with battle-tested materials and processes

### Why Founder Networks Matter

For early-stage startups that might not have a strong track-record to rely on, focusing on founder connections is particularly important. Personal networks often provide:

- **Trust**: People who know you are more willing to take a chance on new technology
- **Patience**: Friends and former colleagues understand the startup journey
- **Feedback**: Honest input helps refine your product and approach
- **References**: Success with known contacts creates credible testimonials

### Transitioning from Network to Scale

While founder networks are crucial initially, sustainable growth requires expanding beyond personal connections:

1. Document what works with early customers
2. Create repeatable sales processes
3. Develop marketing materials based on proven messaging
4. Build systems for tracking and nurturing leads
5. Hire sales professionals who can execute your playbook

Remember: The goal isn't just to land your first customers, but to create a systematic approach that can scale beyond your personal network.
