## Why This Matters for Web3 Startups

The Web3 space presents unique opportunities and challenges for entrepreneurs. Unlike traditional markets, blockchain adoption often requires both technical education and trust-building. Your GTM strategy must account for these factors.

### The Unique Web3 Landscape

Blockchain curiosity varies dramatically across potential clients:

**The Enthusiasm Spectrum:**
- **Crypto-Native**: Ready to adopt, looking for best solution
- **Crypto-Curious**: Interested but need education and reassurance
- **Crypto-Skeptical**: Require extensive proof and risk mitigation
- **Crypto-Hostile**: May never be good targets for your solution

Your approach must be adaptable to all audiences except the last.

### Community as a Business Fundamental
