## Understanding Your Buyer

Before approaching potential customers, create a specific list of the people to whom your solution applies. For B2B sales, identify exact job titles who would benefit from your product.

### The Buyer vs. User Dynamic

Consider the different motivations between buyers and users. In enterprise settings, the person purchasing your product often differs from the person using it daily.

**Example Scenario**:
- **Buyer (VP of Operations)**: Excited about efficiency gains and cost savings
- **User (Data Analyst)**: Concerned about job security and workflow changes

A pitch about replacing manual processes might appeal to a VP but concern the analyst whose job could be affected.

### Mapping the Decision-Making Chain

For enterprise sales, map all stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions:

1. **Economic Buyer**: Controls the budget
   - Usually C-level or VP
   - Cares about ROI and strategic impact
   - Makes final approval

2. **Technical Buyer**: Evaluates feasibility
   - CTO, Tech Lead, or Architect
   - Focuses on integration and security
   - Can veto on technical grounds

3. **User Buyer**: Will use the product daily
   - Individual contributors or managers
   - Cares about ease of use
   - Influences adoption success

4. **Champion**: Your internal advocate
   - Could be any of the above
   - Believes in your solution
   - Helps navigate internal politics

### Creating Detailed Personas

For each stakeholder type, document:

**Demographics**:
- Job title and department
- Years of experience
- Technical sophistication

**Psychographics**:
- Career goals and motivations
- Daily frustrations
- Success metrics

**Decision Factors**:
- What makes them look good?
- What risks concern them?
- How do they evaluate vendors?
