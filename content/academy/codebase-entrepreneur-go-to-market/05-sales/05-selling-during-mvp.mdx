## Selling During the MVP Stage

Selling an MVP requires a different approach than selling a mature product. Success comes from positioning early customers as partners in your journey.

### Leveraging Your Network

Your network is your most valuable asset during the MVP stage:

**Start with Warm Connections**:
- People who know and trust you
- Former colleagues in target industries
- Investors' portfolio companies
- Accelerator connections

**Continuous Engagement**:
- Share your vision early and often
- Update them on progress regularly
- Ask for feedback, not just sales
- Make them feel invested in your success

### Positioning Early Customers as Partners

> Treat your first customers more as partners in your journey than as customers. Be clear and transparent with your first customers that this is a new product, and they are the first to try out something very exciting and innovative that's new to the world.
> — Zoe Leavitt, Co-Founder at glass.fun

### The Partnership Approach

When approaching first customers, frame the relationship differently:

**Traditional Sale**:
- "Buy our perfect solution"
- Fixed features and pricing
- Limited customer input
- Vendor-client relationship

**Partnership Sale**:
- "Help us build the future"
- Flexible features based on needs
- High customer involvement
- Collaborative relationship

### Transparency is Key

Be honest about your stage:

1. **Acknowledge limitations**: "We're early but committed"
2. **Share your vision**: "Here's where we're going"
3. **Request collaboration**: "Your input will shape this"
4. **Offer incentives**: "Early adopter benefits"

### Who Makes Good Early Customers?

**Ideal Early Customers**:
- Innovation-focused organizations
- Companies with specific pain points
- Teams comfortable with iteration
- Organizations that value influence

**Poor Early Customers**:
- Large enterprises requiring perfection
- Highly regulated industries (initially)
- Companies with rigid procurement
- Organizations resistant to change

### Formalizing the Partnership

Consider these collaborative structures:

1. **Customer Advisory Board**:
   - Quarterly strategy meetings
   - Product roadmap input
   - Industry insight sharing
   - Networking opportunities

2. **Design Partnership**:
   - Weekly/monthly feedback sessions
   - Direct access to product team
   - Custom feature development
   - Co-creation of solutions

3. **Early Adopter Program**:
   - Discounted or free access
   - Public case study rights
   - Referral incentives
   - First access to new features

### Benefits for Early Customers

Help them understand what they gain:

- **Competitive advantage**: First to market with new capabilities
- **Influence**: Shape the product to their needs
- **Cost savings**: Early adopter pricing
- **Recognition**: Thought leadership positioning
- **Support**: Direct access to founders

### Managing Expectations

Set clear boundaries:

**What to Promise**:
- Rapid iteration based on feedback
- Direct support access
- Commitment to their success
- Transparent communication

**What NOT to Promise**:
- Perfect stability from day one
- Every requested feature
- Immediate solutions
- Enterprise-grade everything

Early sales during MVP stage aren't about perfection—they're about finding partners who believe in your vision and want to be part of building something transformative.
