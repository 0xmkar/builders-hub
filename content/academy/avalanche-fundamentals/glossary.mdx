| Term | Abbreviation | Previous Term | Description |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Avalanche Consensus | | | A family of consensus protocols that power the Avalanche network, known for high throughput, fast finality, and energy efficiency. The X-Chain uses the core Avalanche consensus protocol, while the P-Chain and C-Chain use the Snowman variant. [Learn more](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals/02-avalanche-consensus-intro/01-avalanche-consensus-intro). |
| Avalanche L1 | L1 | Subnet | An independent, sovereign blockchain network on Avalanche that can have its own validator set, tokenomics, and rules. Avalanche L1s work together to form the broader Avalanche Network. [Learn more](/docs/quick-start/avalanche-l1s). |
| Avalanche Virtual Machine | AVM | | The virtual machine implementation that powers the X-Chain, handling operations on Avalanche Native Tokens. |
| Contract Chain | C-Chain | | An implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that supports the deployment and execution of smart contracts written in Solidity. Uses the Coreth Virtual Machine. [Learn more](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#c-chain). |
| Coreth | | | The virtual machine implementation that powers the C-Chain, enabling Ethereum compatibility on Avalanche. |
| Exchange Chain | X-Chain | | Responsible for operations on digital smart assets known as Avalanche Native Tokens. Uses the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM). [Learn more](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#x-chain). |
| Interchain Messaging | ICM | Teleporter | A protocol that enables communication between blockchains on Avalanche, allowing for secure message passing between different L1s. [Learn more](/academy/interchain-messaging). |
| Interchain Token Transfer | ICTT | | A system that allows tokens to be transferred seamlessly between different Avalanche L1s, enabling greater interoperability within the ecosystem. [Learn more](/academy/interchain-token-transfer). |
| Platform Chain | P-Chain | | Responsible for all validator and Avalanche L1-level operations, including staking, creating new blockchains, and other platform-level functions. Uses the Platform Virtual Machine. [Learn more](/docs/quick-start/primary-network#p-chain). |
| Platform Virtual Machine | | | The virtual machine implementation that powers the P-Chain, handling staking, validator, and Avalanche L1 operations. |
| Primary Network | | | A special Avalanche L1 that runs three blockchains: the P-Chain, C-Chain, and X-Chain. All validators on the Primary Network must stake at least 2,000 AVAX. [Learn more](/docs/quick-start/primary-network). |
| Snowman Consensus | | | A linear chain-optimized variant of the Avalanche consensus protocol used specifically by the P-Chain and C-Chain. Designed for smart contract chains and platform operations. [Learn more](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals/02-avalanche-consensus-intro/03-snowman-consensus). |

## Why Terminology Matters

Understanding these terms is essential for effective communication within the Avalanche ecosystem. The recent terminology changes better reflect the technical architecture and capabilities of the Avalanche platform as it continues to evolve.

As you progress through this course, you'll gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and how they fit into the broader Avalanche ecosystem.
