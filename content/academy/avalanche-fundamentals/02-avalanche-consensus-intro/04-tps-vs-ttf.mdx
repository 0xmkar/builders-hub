To measure blockchain performance we can use two metrics:

- Throughput: How many transaction are finalized per second measured in transactions per second
  (TPS). To also account for the complexity of transactions, sometimes gas per second is used.
- Time to Finality: How long does it take a transaction to go from being submitted to validators to
  being finalized on chain and it's state changes being irreversible. 

These metrics are very different. Blockchain builders aspire to high throughput and very short time to finality.

Let's take an analogy of a train. Each passenger represents a transaction and they all travel from a
train station called "Mempool" to another station calles "Finality". We will use this analogy to
understand the journey of a transaction from the moment it is created until it is finalized. 

## Step 1: Transaction Issuance
When you click *send* in your wallet, it's like the transaction is entering the departure station
"Mempool". There is will wait for the next train (block) to arrive. 

## Step 2: Transaction Inclusion
When the train arrives, it picks up the passengers (transactions) and starts its journey. The
transactions have to pay for the journey (transaction fee, also called gas fee) to get on the train.


## Transaction Fees
The transaction fee for a transaction depends on the complexity of the transaction. In our analogy
this would be similar to the size of the passenger's luggage. The more luggage you have, the more
you have to pay for the journey.

| Transaction Type | Gas Cost | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Native ETH Transfer | 21,000 | Simple transfer of ETH from one address to another |
| ERC-20 Transfer | 65,000 | Standard token transfer using the ERC-20 standard |
| ERC-721 Transfer | 85,000 | NFT transfer using the ERC-721 standard |
| Uniswap V3 Swap | 180,000 | Token swap on Uniswap V3 with concentrated liquidity |
| Contract Deployment | 300,000 | Deploying a new smart contract (simple contract) |
| DAO Vote | 80,000 | Casting a vote in a DAO governance proposal |
| Aave Borrow | 190,000 | Borrowing assets from the Aave protocol |

As you can see from the table, the gas cost of a transaction can vary heavily depending on the
complexity of the transaction. In our analogy this would be similar to some passengers have multiple
car loads of luggage, while others only have a small backpack.

## Block Capacity / Gas Limit
Blocks have a limited capacity, just like a train can only carry a certain volume or weight. The number of
transactions (passengers) that can be included in a block is limited by the `gasLimit` (max mass of
passengers and luggage the train can carry). 

| Blockchain Network | Block Gas Limit | Block Time |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Ethereum | 30M gas | 12 seconds |
| Binance Smart Chain (BSC) | 60M gas | 3 seconds |
| Avalanche C-Chain | 15M gas | 2 seconds |

A blockchain with blocks with a lower limit can have higher throughput than a blockchain with blocks
with a higher limit, if blocks are produced at a much higher rate.


## Block Interval  / Target Block Rate
For the throughput capacity of the blockchain not only the size of the blocks, but also the interval
between blocks is relevant. It is the time it takes for the next train to arrive at the station.  These can vary heavily between different blockchains:

| Blockchain Network | Block Time |
|-------------------|------------|
| Bitcoin | 10 minutes |
| Cardano | 20 seconds |
| Ethereum | 12 seconds |
| Cosmos (Tendermint) | 6 seconds |
| Algorand | 3 seconds |
| Binance Smart Chain (BSC) | 3 seconds |
| Avalanche C-Chain | 2 seconds |
| Solana | 400 milliseconds |
| Avalanche L1 | As low as 350 milliseconds (configurable) |

The block times are not related to the time it takes to finalize a transaction. The block time is
the worst case a transaction has to wait until it is included in a block. The time to finality is 
the time it takes until a transaction is finalized (time to travel to finality) and cannot be reverted anymore.


When the transaction
is *finalized* and unchangeable, it's like the car reaching its destination.

Throughput could be likened to the number of lanes, determining how many cars can pass on the highway in a given amount of time. The more lanes you have, the more cars can pass through, thus increasing the throughput. In a blockchain network, increasing the block size (analogous to adding more lanes) can increase throughput.

Now, imagine you're driving to a specific destination (finality). The time it takes you to get from your starting point (initiation of the transaction) to your destination (confirmation of the transaction) is analogous to the "time to finality." As soon as a car reaches finality, it cannot return or abort the travel.

Our goal is to build highways with many lanes (high throughput) but that bring us to our destination as fast as possible (short time to finality).

### Throughput and Finality of Popular Blockchain Networks

|Network|Throughput|Time to Finality|
|---|---|---|
|Bitcoin|7 TPS|60 min|
|Ethereum|30 TPS|6.4 min|
|Avalanche / Avalanche L1|2500 TPS|~0.8 seconds|

**TPS** &rarr; **Transactions per Second**

Returning to the highway analogy, these networks would look like this:
