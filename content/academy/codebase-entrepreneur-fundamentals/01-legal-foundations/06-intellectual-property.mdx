### Intellectual Property Protection
Protecting your intellectual property is essential in the Web3 space. Implement a three-layered approach:
1. Legal protections
Trademarks for your product name and logo,
Copyrights,
Source code registration
2. Security measures
Ensure you have sufficient encryption and access controls in place to protect your intellectual property.
3. Contractual agreements: 
All team members, contractors, and partners should sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and confidentiality agreements before you start work with them.

Initial IP protection should be considered in your first fundraising round.
