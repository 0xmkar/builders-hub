### Forming Your Legal Entity
After selecting a jurisdiction, you'll need to form a legal entity. In the United States, most startups opt for a C Corporation structure, particularly if they plan to raise venture capital.

For Delaware incorporation, basic requirements include:
- Costs ranging from $50-500 depending on setup details
- Filing a certificate of formation
- Designating a registered agent
- Submitting annual reports and tax filings

While Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) or partnerships might be suitable for some early-stage companies, the C Corp structure typically provides the most flexibility for fundraising and growth.
