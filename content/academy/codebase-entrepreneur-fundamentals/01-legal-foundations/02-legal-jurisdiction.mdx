### Choosing Your Legal Jurisdiction

QUOTE CARD: "The first step any Web3 organization needs to take is to choose the right legal jurisdiction -  or in other words - the place where you're going to register your legal entity. You don't need to live there. You don't need to work there, but this is the place where your business will be created." - Jonathan Rhodes, Founder and President at the Rhodes Companies

The first step for any Web3 organization is selecting the right legal jurisdiction. This decision impacts taxation, privacy, regulatory oversight, and access to funding.

The optimal jurisdiction depends on your project's goals, structure, and target marketsâ€”and should be chosen with both current requirements and long-term adaptability in mind. Startups should look for:

Competitive tax frameworks
Strong privacy protections
Clear digital asset regulations
Legislative support for DAOs and decentralized structures
Efficient corporate registration and governance processes
