### Getting Honest Feedback

Clip: Getting Honest Feedback in Web3 User Interviews

To ensure users provide honest feedback rather than just being polite, build a collaborative culture where they feel like partners in your project. Position them as collaborators and ambassadors rather than just test subjects.

When users feel invested in your product's success, they become more willing to provide critical feedback because they genuinely want the product to improveâ€”both for themselves and so they can recommend it to others.

Engaged users will be patient with bugs and development issues, but will also apply healthy pressure to fix problems that might prevent wider adoption.
