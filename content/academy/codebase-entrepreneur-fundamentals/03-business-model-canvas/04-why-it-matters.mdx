### Why This Matters for Web3 Startups

QUOTE CARD:
" 'If you build it they will come is not a strategy.' That is a maxim that I would argue does not hold real weight." - Michael Martin, Codebase Lead at Ava Labs

The business model canvas is particularly important for Web3 startups because of the complex nature of decentralized business models. Without a clear understanding of who your users are and how you'll provide value, it's easy to fall into the trap of viewing tokens merely as speculative tools rather than representations of real value.

Clip: Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Web3 Business Model Canvases

Web3 founders must remember that sustainable businesses solve genuine pain points for users. The token itself is just a toolâ€”not the product. By focusing on user needs first and token mechanics second, founders can build businesses that create lasting value rather than temporary speculation.

Additionally, the canvas helps founders avoid the "if you build it, they will come" fallacy. User acquisition requires strategic planning, and building features without customer validation wastes valuable resources. Understanding your target users in detail allows you to develop the minimum viable product that addresses their specific needs before expanding into additional features.
