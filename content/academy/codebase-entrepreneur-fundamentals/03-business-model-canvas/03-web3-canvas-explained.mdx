### The Web3 Business Model Canvas Explained

The business model canvas helps companies establish a solid foundation by organizing their thinking around key business elements. For Web3 founders, this tool remains essential but requires expanded thinking about certain components.

In the Web3 context, the definition of "customer" extends beyond traditional consumers to include token holders, community members, followers on social platforms, and contributors to open-source projects. This broader perspective helps founders identify all potential stakeholders who will interact with their product or service.

Web3 businesses also have unique value capture mechanisms that should be reflected in the canvas. These include tokenomics strategies, treasury management approaches, and yield generation methods. Despite these differences, the fundamental questions remain the same: how do you reach your customers, how do you provide them value, and how do you sustain your business?

One major advantage of the business model canvas is that it helps founders become more specific about their target audience. Rather than broadly stating "our customer is a developer," the canvas encourages detailed demographic and psychographic definitions. For example, a more precise definition might be "our customer is a Solidity developer working at Series A companies in the tax strategy sector." This specificity prevents founders from pursuing unproductive paths and facilitates more meaningful conversations with potential users.
