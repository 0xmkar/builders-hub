In a world where the emergence of new blockchains is becoming increasingly common—each playing a significant role in the industry, whether for a short or extended period—it is essential to have a reliable channel for transferring information between different networks. This ensures that assets, messages, and other data can be shared seamlessly across multiple blockchains.

The architecture enabling the connection between two or more blockchains involving Avalanche is built upon two fundamental communication technologies:

1. A channel to connect Avalanche C-Chain with other blockchains outside its ecosystem.

2. A channel to connect Avalanche C-Chain or any blockchain within the Avalanche ecosystem with others in the same ecosystem.

In this course, we will explore both systems:

**Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)** – The system that allows Avalanche to connect with external blockchains.

**Inter Chain Messaging (ICM)** – The system that facilitates communication within the Avalanche ecosystem.

These technologies play a crucial role in fostering blockchain interoperability, enhancing connectivity, and enabling seamless data and asset transfers across different networks.
